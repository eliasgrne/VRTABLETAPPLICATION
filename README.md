Immersive VR Playlist Experience is a virtual reality application designed to deliver curated YouTube video content in an immersive and user-friendly environment. The app allows users to synchronize specific YouTube playlists—such as Activities, Workout, City Walk 180, Nature, and Documentary—directly into the VR space using dedicated buttons for quick access. These playlists are integrated using their unique YouTube playlist IDs, allowing for precise and reliable content loading. 
In addition to these predefined categories, users can create and manage their own custom playlists, which can be remotely pushed to a connected VR headset for playback. 
This feature is especially useful for educators, fitness instructors, or content curators who want to guide experiences from a separate device.

The user interface follows a minimalist design philosophy, featuring a white background with black text for maximum readability and a clean, professional look. 
The layout avoids childish or gamified elements, aligning with academic and professional standards. The app supports 180° and 360° video formats, spatial audio, and intuitive VR controls to enhance the immersive experience.

This application is built for standalone VR headsets such as the Meta Quest and includes a companion web or mobile interface for playlist management and remote control. 
It integrates with the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch and stream playlist content. To use the API, users must create a Google Cloud project, enable the YouTube Data API, and generate an API key, which can then be added to the app’s configuration.
A placeholder is provided in the code for inserting this key. The codebase is thoroughly documented with clear and detailed comments, making it easy for developers to understand, customize, and extend the application.
